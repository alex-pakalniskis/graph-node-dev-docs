# Subgraph best practices and pitfalls

### `Bytes` type for entity `id` fields

> Each entity must have an `id` field, which must be of type `Bytes!` or `String!`. It is generally recommended to use `Bytes!`, unless the `id` contains human-readable text, since entities with `Bytes!` id's will be faster to write and query as those with a `String!` `id`. The `id` field serves as the primary key, and needs to be unique among all entities of the same type. For historical reasons, the type `ID!` is also accepted and is a synonym for `String!`. \

Example

```graphql
type TokenBalance @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  amount: Int!
  token: Token!
}
```

### Immutable entities

> By default, entities are mutable, meaning that mappings can load existing entities, modify them and store a new version of that entity. Mutability comes at a price, and for entity types for which it is known that they will never be modified, for example, because they simply contain data extracted verbatim from the chain, it is recommended to mark them as immutable with `@entity(immutable: true)`. Mappings can make changes to immutable entities as long as those changes happen in the same block in which the entity was created. Immutable entities are much faster to write and to query, and should therefore be used whenever possible.

Example

```graphql
type Gravatar @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
  accepted: Boolean
}
```

### Reduce number (or entirely avoid) [eth\_calls](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth\_call)

> Many smart contracts do not emit all necessary data in their events directly. To determine the new smart contract state after a completed transaction, it is often necessary to send an [eth\_call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth\_call) back to the smart contract to retrieve that data. However, JSON RPC calls are generally slow. Each call usually takes 100ms up to several seconds to resolve. Thatâ€™s why developers are discouraged from using them at all in their UIs for displaying information. These eth\_calls are also slow if they run as part of the mappings inside the Graph Node.

Strategies

* Only do `eth_calls` once and cache the result or store in DB
* Use data from the event itself and calculate information in the subgraph

### Avoid large arrays

> When we access an array of an entity we are actually getting a copy of that data. Therefore, if we update the data and save the entity, we are simply making a copy of the array, while the original is left unchanged. This is not a problem for small arrays with fewer than 50 or so entries. However, if it contains a larger amount of data and changes frequently it will bloat the database.\
> \
> The reason for this is because of a powerful capability in Graph Node known as ["time-travel queries."](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/pull/1397) Originally implemented so that Graph Node can handle chain reorgs and ensure data accuracy by tracking state at a certain block number and block hash, this feature also empowered users to query the subgraph at any specific point in time, giving access to rich historical data. In order to achieve this, Graph Node is keeping track of all the changes within all the entities for any given subgraph.

Strategies

* Leverage the `@derivedFrom` feature within entities to significantly enhance storage performance and give your subgraph a clean and optimized data storage architecture

### Aggregations

> Aggregations are declared in the subgraph schema through two types: one that stores the raw data points for the time series, and one that defines how raw data points are to be aggregated.\
> \
> A timeseries is an entity type with the annotation `@entity(timeseries: true)`. It must have an `id` attribute of type `Int8` and a `timestamp` attribute of type `Timestamp`. It must not also be annotated with `immutable: false` as timeseries are always immutable.
>
> \
> An aggregation is defined with an `@aggregation` annotation. The annotation must have two arguments:
>
> * `intervals`: a non-empty array of intervals; currently, only `hour` and `day` are supported
> * `source`: the name of a timeseries type. Aggregates are computed based on the attributes of the timeseries type.
>
> The aggregation type must have an `id` attribute of type `Int8` and a `timestamp` attribute of type `Timestamp`.
>
> \- [The Graph docs](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/aggregations.md)

Example

```graphql
type Data @entity(timeseries: true) {
  id: Int8!
  timestamp: Timestamp!
  price: BigDecimal!
}

type Stats @aggregation(intervals: ["hour", "day"], source: "Data") {
  id: Int8!
  timestamp: Timestamp!
  sum: BigDecimal! @aggregate(fn: "sum", arg: "price")
}
```
